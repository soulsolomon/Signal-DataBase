# Signal-simulation and Logger (Ongoing)

## Introduction

Quick, reliable data logging is a key requirement for tests from component characterization to prolonged endurance testing to the evaluation of large dataset. This project sets out a way to simulate real-world signals collection, filter and store them in a simple database. This project also provides a platform to interact with stored signal data through Web front-end page. The system invloves the following steps:

* Signal collection
* Filtering 
* Storing in local DB
* Visualization through a local Web-server
